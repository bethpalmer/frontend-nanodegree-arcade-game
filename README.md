# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This clone of a classic arcade game contributes to the required coursework on the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Front-end Nanodegree program. It effectively tests the skills learnt during the object-orientated module of that course.

### Accessing the game

The game can be access through any browser page.

**NOTE:**
You will need to have **JavaScript** enabled in your browser to successfully load the game.
Although this is normally enabled by default, you can find a useful guide on how to enable JavaScript for each of the different browsers [here](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-enable-javascript/).

### Playing the game

The basic objective of this game is to get your player from the start position on the grass at the bottom of the screen to the water at the top of the screen, avoiding the enemy bugs who will kill you if you collide.

The character can be controlled by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
Each arrow will send the character one tile in the direction of the arrow.

### Acknowledgments

The basic game engine for this game was provided by **Udacity** as part of their Front-end Nanodegree program course requirement.

Characters and functionality have been added by **Beth Palmer** to make the game useable.
